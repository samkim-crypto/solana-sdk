//! BLS12-381 elliptic curve operations for Solana programs, wrapping the
//! native syscalls defined in [SIMD-0388].

//!
//! # Output buffer contract
//!
//! Every `_assign` method writes into a caller-supplied
//! [`MaybeUninit`](core::mem::MaybeUninit) buffer and reports success as a
//! `bool`:
//!
//! - On `true`, the buffer is fully initialized and may be `assume_init`ed.
//! - On `false`, treat it as uninitialized, even if it held a valid value
//!   going in. A failed operation may write part of the buffer before
//!   detecting the error, so it poisons its output.
//!
//! The `true` case is a soundness requirement: reading an uninitialized byte is
//! undefined behavior. SIMD-0388 does not state that a syscall fills the buffer
//! on success.
//!
//! Nothing constrains a *failing* syscall, hence the poisoning rule above
//! rather than a guarantee that the buffer is left untouched.
//!
//! # The all-zero encoding is not the identity
//!
//! The point types implement `bytemuck::Zeroable`, so `G1Point::zeroed()`
//! compiles. All-zero is not infinity, and is not a point at all, since
//! `(0, 0)` does not satisfy `y^2 = x^3 + 4`. [`G1Point::infinity`] is the
//! identity.
//!
//! [`G1Point::infinity`]: g1::G1Point::infinity
//!
//! # Aliasing
//!
//! SIMD-0388 does not specify whether the result pointer may alias an input
//! pointer. This crate is unaffected: `_assign` methods take `&self` alongside
//! `&mut MaybeUninit<Self>`, so an aliasing call cannot be expressed in safe
//! Rust.
