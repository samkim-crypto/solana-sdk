# solana-bls12-381

BLS12-381 elliptic curve operations for Solana programs, wrapping the native
syscalls defined in
[SIMD-0388](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0388-bls12-381-syscalls.md).

Intended for on-chain pairing-based cryptography: BLS signature verification
and zero-knowledge proof (e.g. Groth16) validation.

## Features

- **Zero-copy deserialization.** Types are `#[repr(transparent)]` and implement
  `bytemuck::Pod`, so instruction data can be cast directly into curve points
  without allocation.
- **In-place operations.** Every group operation has an `_assign` variant that
  writes into a caller-supplied `MaybeUninit` buffer, saving ~37 CU per call
  and keeping large results off the 4KB stack.
- **Validated and unchecked APIs.** Group operations validate their operands by
  default; `_unchecked` variants skip the subgroup check for cheaper
  accumulation.
- **Pairing checks.** `pairing_check` tests whether a product of pairings is the
  identity without materializing a 576-byte `Gt` element, and refuses to
  succeed on an empty batch.
- **Dual endianness.** Big-endian (the canonical Zcash/IETF encoding) and
  little-endian layouts.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
solana-bls12-381 = "0.1.0"
```

The `bytemuck` feature is enabled by default and provides the `Pod` and
`Zeroable` implementations used for zero-copy casting. On-chain builds that do
not need them can set `default-features = false`. Off-chain builds always
include them, since the host implementation depends on them internally.

### Zero-copy point addition

```rust
use solana_bls12_381::{G1Point, Endianness};
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;

// Cast raw instruction data directly to `G1Point` references.
let p1: &G1Point = bytemuck::cast_ref(raw_bytes_1);
let p2: &G1Point = bytemuck::cast_ref(raw_bytes_2);

// The output buffer is never read before it is written, so it does not need
// to be initialized.
let mut out = MaybeUninit::uninit();

let success = p1.add_assign(p2, &mut out, Endianness::Little);
assert!(success);

// SAFETY: `add_assign` returned `true`, so `out` is fully initialized.
let sum = unsafe { out.assume_init() };
```

### Output buffer contract

Every `_assign` method follows the same contract:

- On `true`, the output buffer is fully initialized and may be `assume_init`ed.
- On `false`, it must be treated as uninitialized and must not be read, **even
  if it held a valid value before the call**. A failed operation may write part
  of the buffer before detecting the error, so any prior contents are no longer
  guaranteed to be valid.

Permitting `assume_init` on `true` requires that the syscall wrote every byte of
the buffer, since reading an uninitialized byte is undefined behavior.
SIMD-0388 does not state this. The guarantee instead follows from consensus: the
result buffer is observable to the program — its contents can be logged,
returned, or fed into a later syscall — so an implementation that left a byte
unwritten would produce a different program result from Agave and fork the
network. `test_success_writes_full_buffer` pins the property.

Nothing constrains what a _failing_ syscall leaves in the buffer, hence the
poisoning rule above rather than a guarantee that the buffer is left untouched.

To reuse buffers across a loop, keep two `MaybeUninit` buffers, point a pair of
references at them, and swap the *references* each iteration:

```rust
use solana_bls12_381::{G1Point, Endianness};
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;

let e = Endianness::Little;

// The empty sum is infinity, so this loop is total: it needs no special case
// for an empty slice and cannot panic on one.
let mut buf_a = MaybeUninit::new(G1Point::infinity(e));
let mut buf_b = MaybeUninit::uninit();
let (mut acc, mut scratch) = (&mut buf_a, &mut buf_b);

for p in points {
    // SAFETY: `acc` is initialized, by `new` above and by the previous
    // iteration's add.
    let lhs = unsafe { acc.assume_init_ref() };
    // The early return is load-bearing: on failure `scratch` is poisoned and
    // must not become the accumulator or be read afterwards.
    if !lhs.add_assign_unchecked(p, &mut *scratch, e) {
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
    }
    // Swaps two pointers, not two points.
    core::mem::swap(&mut acc, &mut scratch);
}

// SAFETY: `acc` was initialized before the loop and stays initialized.
let total = unsafe { acc.assume_init() };
```

The `&mut` indirection is the whole point. Swapping the two `MaybeUninit`
buffers *by value* — the obvious way to write this — moves 96 bytes three times
through a temporary, which on SBF is three `sol_memcpy_` syscalls at ~54 CU per
iteration. Over an eight-point sum that is 1,546 CU against 1,112 for the
version above: 434 CU, 28% of the accumulation, for a change that is otherwise
invisible.

Seeding from `points[0]` instead of infinity would save one addition (~144 CU),
but it panics on an empty slice, and a panic aborts the transaction. If the
points come from instruction data, reject the empty case explicitly with
`split_first` before taking that saving.

### Multi-pairing check (BLS signatures, ZK proofs)

```rust
use solana_bls12_381::{G1Point, G2Point, pairing_check, Endianness};

let g1_points: &[G1Point] = get_g1_batch();
let g2_points: &[G2Point] = get_g2_batch();

// Evaluates e(P_1, Q_1) * ... * e(P_n, Q_n) == 1
if pairing_check(g1_points, g2_points, Endianness::Big) != Ok(true) {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```

`pairing_check` returns `Err` when the check could not be run at all —
mismatched or over-long batches, an empty batch, or an invalid point. `Err` is
not the same as "verification failed", but both must be treated as failure.
Compare against `Ok(true)` as above; never branch on `.is_ok()`.

`pairing_check` rejects an empty batch, while `pairing_map` returns the identity
for one as the syscall requires. The divergence is deliberate: `pairing_check` is
a verification primitive whose inputs are typically built from
attacker-controlled instruction data, and a zero-length batch that reported
`Ok(true)` would be a verification bypass. For the empty product, call
`pairing_map` and compare against `GtElement::identity`.

### Compute unit costs

The syscalls themselves are charged by the runtime, at the `bls12_381_*` rates
in `solana-program-runtime`'s execution budget. What this crate adds on top is
small, and depends only on how a result is returned:

| Wrapper                                                                                   | Added CU |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `validate` — returns `bool`                                                               | 11       |
| `_assign` forms — write into a caller's `MaybeUninit`                                     | 13–17    |
| `pairing_map_assign`                                                                      | 16       |
| `pairing_check` — includes the `is_identity` comparison                                   | 69       |
| Allocating forms — `add_unchecked`, `sub_unchecked`, `neg_unchecked`, `mul`, `decompress` | 51–54    |

The allocating figure is dominated by the `Option<Self>` construction rather
than the byte copy: it is roughly the same whether the output is a 96-byte G1
point or a 576-byte `Gt` element. Choosing an `_assign` form over its
allocating counterpart therefore saves ~37 CU per operation, whatever the type
— the difference between the last two rows.

Purely local operations issue no syscall, so these figures are the whole cost:

| Local operation                                                       | CU |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- |
| Borrow from instruction data — `from_bytes_ref`, `bytemuck::cast_ref` | 2  |
| Copy — `from_bytes`                                                   | 18 |
| `Scalar::is_zero`                                                     | 13 |
| `is_infinity` — G1 / G2                                               | 29 / 28 |
| `GtElement::is_identity`                                              | 28 |

Array equality lowers to the `sol_memcmp_` syscall, whose charge does not depend
on the length. That is why comparing a 576-byte `Gt` element costs the same as
comparing a 96-byte point, and why folding those bytes into 64-bit words in the
VM instead is not faster.

For budgeting, the measured totals — runtime charge plus this crate's
overhead — of the operations most likely to dominate an instruction:

| Operation                                                    | CU                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `validate` — G1 / G2                                         | 1,576 / 1,977                       |
| `add_assign_unchecked` — G1 / G2                             | 144 / 219                           |
| `add_unchecked` (allocating) — G1                            | 180                                 |
| `add_assign` (validated) — G1                                | 3,300                               |
| `neg_assign_unchecked` — G1                                  | 143                                 |
| `mul_assign` — G1                                            | 4,642                               |
| `decompress_assign` — G1 / G2                                | 2,114 / 3,063                       |
| `pairing_check` — 1 / 2 / 3 / 8 pairs                        | 25,514 / 38,536 / 51,559 / 116,675  |
| Sum of 8 untrusted G1 points, validated once, in place       | 13,712                              |
| Sum of 8 untrusted G2 points, validated once, in place       | 17,565                              |

The two sums use the loop documented above, infinity seed included. Figures
reproduce to within ~2 CU: adding or removing code elsewhere in a program
perturbs codegen by about that much, so treat differences under ~5 CU as noise.

These are net of a no-op instruction, so add your own entrypoint and
instruction parsing on top. Everything here fits inside the 200,000 CU default
instruction limit: a three-pair Groth16 check leaves ~148,000 CU for the rest
of the instruction, and even an eight-pair batch leaves ~83,000.

#### Designing around the costs

**Do not `validate` a point you are about to multiply or pair.** The
multiplication and pairing syscalls run the full field, curve-equation and
subgroup check on every input themselves, so a `validate` beforehand buys
nothing and costs 1,576 CU per G1 point and 1,977 per G2 point. Validating a
point before `mul_assign` measures 6,219 CU against 4,642 for the multiplication
alone; validating two G1 and two G2 points before a two-pair `pairing_check`
measures 45,643 against 38,536. `add_assign_unchecked` and
`sub_assign_unchecked` are the exception — those check the field and the curve
equation but skip the subgroup check, which is exactly what `validate` adds.

**Batch your pairings.** Only the first pair in a batch is charged at
`bls12_381_one_pair_cost`; every additional pair is charged at
`bls12_381_additional_pair_cost`, roughly half as much. A three-pair check
issued as one batch measures 51,559 CU against 76,539 as three separate calls —
24,980 CU saved.

**Validate at the trust boundary, not in the loop.** The validation syscall is
charged at roughly twelve times the addition syscall it guards. Summing eight
points with `add_assign` re-validates the accumulator every iteration: 26,322 CU
against 13,712 for validating the eight inputs once and accumulating with
`add_assign_unchecked` — 48% of the total. The fraction grows with batch size.

**Swap the references, not the buffers.** `core::mem::swap` on two
`MaybeUninit<G1Point>`s is three `sol_memcpy_` syscalls; on two `&mut` to them
it is two register moves. Over an eight-point sum the by-value loop measures
1,546 CU against 1,112 for the by-reference loop shown above — 434 CU, 28% of
the accumulation.

**Prefer the `_assign` forms in loops.** Each call avoids the ~37 CU the
allocating form spends constructing its `Option<Self>`.

**Take points uncompressed when you can afford the bytes.** Decompression
validates, so it replaces rather than adds to a `validate` — but it costs 2,114
CU against 1,576. Eight uncompressed points cost 13,712 CU to validate and sum;
the same eight compressed cost 17,975. That is 4,263 CU for 384 bytes of
instruction data.

**Put the many-element side of the protocol in G1.** Every G1 operation is
cheaper than its G2 counterpart: 1,576 against 1,977 to validate, 144 against
219 to add, 2,114 against 3,063 to decompress. Aggregating eight points costs
13,712 CU in G1 and 17,565 in G2.

**Endianness is free.** The runtime charges the same for the `_LE` and `_BE`
curve IDs, and selecting between them costs nothing measurable in the wrapper.
Pick whichever matches your data.

Borrowing a point out of instruction data costs 2 CU and copying one costs 18.
Neither is worth optimizing against a 128 CU addition syscall, let alone a
25,445 CU pairing.

### Validation

Group operations validate both operands by default: the coordinates are checked
to be field elements, the point to satisfy the curve equation, and the point to
lie in the prime-order subgroup. The `_unchecked` variants skip these checks.
Multiplication, decompression and the pairing operations are validated by the
syscall itself and have no `_unchecked` variant — calling `validate` before one
of them pays for the same work twice.

More precisely, of the checks `validate` performs:

| Operation                                | Field | Curve equation | Subgroup |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------- | -------- |
| `validate`                               | yes   | yes            | yes      |
| `add_assign_unchecked`, `sub_*_unchecked`| yes   | yes            | no       |
| `mul_assign`                             | yes   | yes            | yes      |
| `decompress_assign`                      | yes   | yes            | yes      |
| `pairing_map_assign`, `pairing_check`    | yes   | yes            | yes      |

So the only thing `validate` adds over an `_unchecked` group operation is the
subgroup check — and that is the expensive part.

The subgroup check dominates the cost: the validation syscall is charged at
roughly twelve times the addition syscall it guards. Since the subgroup is closed under
addition, an accumulator built from validated points remains valid: validate at
the trust boundary and accumulate with `add_assign_unchecked`.

### Aliasing

SIMD-0388 does not specify whether the result pointer of a syscall may alias an
input pointer. This crate is unaffected either way: every `_assign` method takes
`&self` alongside `&mut MaybeUninit<Self>`, so an aliasing call cannot be
expressed in safe Rust.
